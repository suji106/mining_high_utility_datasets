Description:
Developed two strategies based on u-list structure and item pair co-existence map in this algorithm for efficiently pruning the search space to avoid exhaustive search. Experimental analysis over various databases show that the proposed algorithm outperforms few existing two-phase algorithms like UP-Growth, etc. in terms of running times and memory consumption.
